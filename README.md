# THIS IS THE PROJECT ON THE BASIS OF THE SCIKIT LEARN DATASETS BREAST_CANCER 
+ main objective this project is to predict the types of diagnosis in the
+ breast cancer and identify this ..
+ using some modules like scikit_learn
+ EDA perform
+ data exploration and visulalize
+ data describe
+ data model selection ( we use LinearRegression)
+ split the datasets into train and test dataset
+ then fit with x_Train,y_Train
+ predict with x_Test and find the accuracy

+ this is prediction path for this datasets and check the diagnosis
+ ONE (1) :  REPRESENTATION "MALIGNANT"
+ ZERO(0) : REPRESENTATION "BENIGN"
